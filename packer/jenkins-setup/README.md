# Jenkins Install Script

This script will install a local Jenkins server, and install plugins specified in a file. This script currently only works on Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distributions, but will be modified in the future to use the latest Jenkins war file downloaded directly from jenkins.io

### Usage:

Installing:
```
sudo ./jenkins.sh -i 
```

Uninstalling:

```
sudo ./jenkins.sh -u
```
## Future:
This repository will contain the currently present local installation as well as a Docker based install.
